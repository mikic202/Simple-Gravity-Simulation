<h1 align = center>Simple Gravity Simulation</h1>
This project represents how objects behave in the gravity field. This is a simple simulation and probably can't replicate more complex behaviours.
<h3 align = center>How to start</h3>
First, you need to have pygame installed and working on your computer. If you do that, you need to download the repository and open the window.py file. Then, you need to add some objects ( there will be three objects added to the simulation from the start). Currently, you can odd objects only by adding them directly to the _objects list attribute in the code. Schemat of creating objects is: MassObject(name(type string), mass(float type), Vector(pos_x, pos_y), radius(int type), Vector(speed_x, speed_y), Vector(acceleration_x, acceleration_y)). Speed and acceleration are optional. Then you need to just compile the file.
<h3 align = center>Things to do</h3>

- adding objects to simulation not from code
- find and fix mistakes

<h3 align = center>General thoughts</h3>
Everything seems to be fine, and after checking the equations, they are also all right, but for some reason, I think that there is a mistake in the simulation. This may be because objects orbit around each other a bit too quickly
