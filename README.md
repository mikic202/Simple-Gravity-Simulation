<h1 align = center>Simple Gravity Simulation</h1>
This is project represents how objects behave in gravity field. This is simple simulation and probably can't replicate more complex behaviours.
<h3 align = center>How to start</h3>
First you need to have pygame instaled and working on your computer. If you do that you need to download the repository and open window.py file. Than you need to add some objects ( there will be three objects added to the simulation from the start). Curently you can odd objects only by adding them directly to the _objects list atribute in the code. Schemat of creating objects is: MassObject(name(type string), mass(float type), Vector(pos_x, pos_y), radius(int type), Vector(speed_x, speed_y), Vector(acceleration_x, acceleration_y)). Speed and acceleration are optional. Than you need to just compile the file.
<h3 align = center>Things to do</h3>

- add system of adding objects to simulation
- find and fix mistakes

<h3 align = center>General thoughts</h3>
Everything seems to be fine and anfter checking equasions they are also alright, but for some reason I think that there is mistake nin simulation. This may be because objects orbit around each other a bit ot quickly
